    <h1>Pao Developement Comments</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is an high level documentation not only to some of the ideas and
      gudilines, that I have tryed to follow when programming the pao
      method, but also tecnical aids that I have used. Form
      discussions with Matthias, I have thought that they
      could be useful even to others. I hope this will be so.</p>
    <p>I am new to fortran, and the thing that I have missed most are
      templates (parametric types and fuctions, that should come in
      fortan 200x). There were moments where I had the impression of
      hitting a wall trying to implement the things using a nice high
      level design in fortran. On the whole I think that the design
      that came out is not too bad, and as language Fortran 90 isn't
      so bad either. There are some things in it,
      that I quite like (but where are the templates??;). Well anyway
      I am quite happy with my
      solutions. Probabily some of my ideas do not reflect the
      standard practices of the fortran programmers. If you have
      suggestions, I will be glad to hear them (and maybe even apply
      them!;).
    <h2>Pao Method</h2>
    <p>For the moment I will not give a real description of the pao
      method, it is basically the one developed by Gerd Berghold, only
      that I use another parametrization of the unitary transformation
      and I made the projection/injection explicit. The rest is
      basically the same. A more in depth
      description should come at some point in the future.</p>
    <h2>Pao files</h2>
    <p>At the moment the pao component has different files,
    these are more global:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>cp_prep_globals.h</code> the preprocessor macros for
	error handling.</li>
      <li><code>cp_log_handling.F</code> the routines to log, errors,
	notes,... (contains the logger object and routines to convert
	numbers to strings).</li>
      <li><code>cp_error_handling.F</code> the routines to perform
	error handling</li>
      <li><code>cp_output_handling.F</code> the routines to write some
	output data</li>
      <li><code>cp_lbfgs.F</code> the <a href="http://www.ece.nwu.edu/~ciyou/index.html#lbfgs">lbfgs quasi newton optimizer</a>
	used by the pao method</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and these are more pao related:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>cp_pao_types.F</code> all the (global) types that are
	related to the pao method</li>
      <li><code>cp_pao_types_tests.F</code> some tests for the pao
	types</li>
      <li><code>cp_pao_utils.F</code> various utility routines, some
	are quite general and should be moved to a less pao specific
	place</li>
      <li><code>cp_plain_rot.F</code> the plain rotation routines, and
	the one that calculates the unitary trasformation with
	them</li>
      <li><code>cp_plain_rot_tests.F</code> some tests forthe plain
	rotations</li>
      <li><code>cp_pao_obj_function.F</code> the functional (objective
	function) that pao tries to optimize</li>
      <li><code>cp_pao_optimizer.F</code> the code that optimizes the
	objective function (calling the real optimizer)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Developement Environement and guidelines</h2>
    <p>These are the ideas behind the developement of the pao
      method. These have been thought during the developement, and I
      try to guarantee that they are respected in all the new things
      and modification that I do, but there is always some code that has been
      written before I decided the new guideline. In this case I do
      not always go back fixing the code. In fact I think that
      functioning code is the most important thing and changing
      introduces new bugs and and needs time, so the spped of my fixes
      depend on
      how much the problem disturbs me. If something disturbs you this
      is a BIG reason to do the changes, so tell me... anyway I like
      to have clean code and refactor often (that one of the reasons of all my
      error checking...)</p>
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>I like object orientation, and I think that it is very useful
      in doing big programs. Not every aspect of it can be done
      efficiently in fortran, and this has already been discussed
      elsewere, but some aspects of it can, and in particular you
      can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>hide the inner working of an object</li>
      <li>force the acces through an interface, guarenteeing the
	internal consistence</li>
      <li>use a uniform interface to do similar things</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think that for a library also the last thing is very
      important: it makes the library more consistent, and after a
      while you know "intuitively" how the things are supposed to
      work, you don't have to lookit up every time.</p>
    <p>Well with this idea I choosed a set of generic procedure names
      that a type can implement. The type would implement them with
      private names and have a public interface with the public
      generic name.</p>
    <p>This uses generic function, and does not impose any slow down
      because the function is choosen at compile time. But there is a
      drawback: normally the error messages of the compiler are less
      helpful, and the search of the function def can be a little more
      complex. On the plus side generic names are easy to remember, and if you
      change the type of some variable (or the name of the type), you
      don't have to change the code that uses it.</p>
    <h4>core methods</h4>
    <p>These are the names the I have choosen, I have put a two letter
      prefix to avoid name clashes (I like to import a module without
      renaming). The prefix was cp, but then I was told to use qs, and
      then cp again, but I don't find so funny to change it, so for
      now it stays qs (but I am ready to chage it again upon
      request).</p>
    <h5>required methods</h5>
    <p>These are methods that every type is expected to implement,
      without exception (even if it doesen't need them, to keep the
      consistence).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>call qs_init(obj,...)</code> initializes <code>obj</code>
	(the first argument) using the following (normally keyed)
	arguments. It
	must be called prior to every other operation on the
	object. Some initialization argument may be required</li>
      <li><code>call qs_dealloc_ref(obj,...)</code> releases all the memory
	that was allocated by <code>obj</code>. Must be called when an
	object is no longer nedeed (otherwise there could be
	leaks)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are types that are better always seen as pointers
      (as linked list for example). In this case the previous method
      are not so suited. In this case two other method can be used
      instread:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>qs_create(obj,..)</code> allocates and initializes a
	type. <code>obj</code>will point to the new type</li>
      <li><code>qs_dealloc(obj,..)<code> deallocates the memory
	    allocated by <code>obj</code>, <em>and</em> <code>obj</code>
	    itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>common methods</h5>
    <p>These methods are not required, but are often present.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>call qs_get(obj,...)</code> returns various attributes
	of <code>obj</code>. All the other arguments are
	optional. Some attributes might not be elements of obj (they
	might be calculated or returned from sub elements of the
	structure)</li>
      <li><code>call qs_set(obj,...)</code> sets the value of various
	attributes of <code>obj</code> (not all the attributes must be
	settable, in fact some of my types are a little too complex
	because I made too many attributes changeable)</li>
      <li><code>qs_valid(obj,...)</code> returns true if the object is
	valid. Only minimal testing should be performed. This method
	is expected to be called quit often.</li>
      <li><code>qs_validate(obj,...)</code> returns true if the object
	is valid, an extensive series of tests should be performed. It
	is expected that this method will be called only once.</li>
      <li><code>next(iterator,...)</code> moves the iterator to the
	next element, and returns true if the iterator is still valid
	(not past end). Useful when you need more than one thing from
	the iterator.</code></li>
      <li><code>get_next(iterator,...)</code> moves the iterator to the
	next element, and return a pointer to the actual
	element. Returns a disassociated pointer when at end.
	Useful when you need just one thing from the iterator.
	Depending on the implementation the iterator after a call to
	<code>get_next</code> could be on the next or the previous
	element.</code></li>
      <li><code>qs_did_change(obj,...)</code> tells the stucture
	<code>obj</code> that some of its internal parameters have
	changed and (if obj caches some values) that these could now
	be invalid.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Special methods</h4>
    <p>Obviosly every type has his specific operations. One can be
      stantarized is a function to directly get an attribute
      (without needing a variable). This should also be a generic
      function so that another object with the same attribute can use
      the same function name. I.e.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>qs_get_<em>something</em>(obj,...)</code> returns
	<em>something</em> from <code>obj</code></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Memory policy</h3>
    <p>If you use pointers, or allocate memory dinamically thenyou
      should have a memory policy to avoid leaks. I am accustomed to
      have at least reference counting, but it is quite some work to
      implement it well in fortran, so for the moment I choose a very
      simple policy. I still don't know if it will be really appliable
      always, but here is it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have a type, you must call <code>qs_init</code>
	before using it, and <code>qs_dealloc_ref</code> after being
	done with it. There are no exceptions to this rule, so you can
	see a leak even without fully understand the code.</li>
      <li>Pointers (except when hidden in types) should not be
	allocated; are used to give back subelements of a type,
	and should be nullified after use. There can be exceptions to
	this rule, but think well if an allocatable object would not
	do.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I found a rather subtle and unpleasant drawback to these rules: if
      a type has subobjects in it (not pointer to them) and gives back 
      pointers to them, it should be a target in almost all the function
      calls, otherwise it could give back pointers to temporary objects
      (if copy-in happened), and that might not be what you want. Note
      that putting a target everywhere is not a bat idea if your
      structure is big, because you avoid copy-in/copy-out. So maybe I
      should add the following rule:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If in doubt put a "target" in the (derived-type) arguments
	of your procedures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As I use pointers I should say a couple of things about
      them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pointers to derived types and scalar types take up just the
	same space as one int (as is expected).</li>
      <li>Pointers to array can take up to 40 bytes of storage (but
	only when set). It seems that a pointer to an array allocates
	some structure with information about the array when it is
	set. Maybe it also caches the values for (1,1) arrays (at
	least in pgf90), and probabily it is to have pointers to
	arrays with other starting points, or stride that is not 1.
	So try to avoid them</li>
      <li>my code generates no aliased objects (other than the obvious
	hamiltonian, global_environement, ...). So it can be assumed
	that two pointers do not overlap</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Error, logging and output</h3>
    <p>I find testing and error and output handling very important in software
      developement, so I have put a couple of facilities to make it
      easier. I have defined three modules, one that does logging
      (qs_log_handling), and one that does error handling
      (qs_error_handling), and one that deals with the output of data.</p>
    <p>The idea with them is to centralize or delegate the decision
      about what to log and where to log, so that you don't have to
      decide it in the code you write. This way your computing code
      does not become mingled with code that has to decide what to
      log, where to log, if it should stop,...</p>
    <p>For the moment these module are very simple in their
      implementation, but they give the necessary hooks to be extended
      in the future.</p>
    <p><em>Important</em> to use them you must put a <code>call
	qs_init_default_loggers</code> at the beginning of your
      programm</p>
    <h4>Error handling</h4>
    <p>I will discuss the most mature (and the most used by me
      at moment) of these module: qs_error_handling. The idea behind
      it is largely drawn from the error handling of the way it is
      done in the fortran 90 version of the nag numerical library. See
      for example the error handling part of the 
      <a href="http://www.nag.co.uk/numeric/FN/manual/pdf/genint/c00s01_essintro_fn04.pdf">
	introduction to the nag library</a>. The idea is that almost
      every function has an optional parameter named error to control its
      behaviour in the case of error.</p>
    <p>To keep the handling of errors simple I have written a couple
      of procedures that can help, especially if your routines have a
      standard form:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>call qs_assert(condition, level, error_nr, fromWhere,
	  message, error,failure)</code>  checks
	<code>condition</code>, if it is false then the optional
	argument <code>failure</code> is set to true.
	This can be used to do many assertion one fater the other and
	check at the end if one failed.</li>
      <li><code>call qs_error_message(level, fromWhere, message,
	  error)</code> writes an error message (if the printLevel of
	the <code>error</code> is not too high.</li>
      <li><code>call qs_propagate_error(iError, fromWhere, message,
	  error, failure)</code> if the internal error iError of a
	subroutine is set (i.e. if there was an error in the
	subroutine) propagates the error to the actual error
	(i.e. sets error level and number to the ones of iError) and
	sets the optional parameter <code>failure</code> to true</li>
      </ul>
    <p>To make the error logging more efficient I have defined some
      macros in "qs_prep_globals.h". One of the most useful macros is
      <code><b>QSSourceFileRef</b>()</code>, this macro inserts the actual
      filename and line number as string.  It can be used to make
      error messages much more useful: you can write <code>"error in
      "//QSSourceFileRef()</code> and it is expanded like <code>error
	in /actual/file/path.F line 183</code>. Be careful with
      this macro: it exmands inline with the full Path of the actual
      file, if the path is long and the line where you expand it grows
      longer than the maximum line length of the compiler you could
      have problems (i.e. use it in short lines).</p>
    <p>There are other macros that can save a little typing and
      guarantee that the test is performed inline (without a function
      call). They are thought for short checks, and must be all in one
      line. These are QSPrecondition, QSPostcondition, QSInvariant,
      QSAssert. They all simply call <code>qs_assert</code>, but
      guarantee inlining, for example<br>
      <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QSPrecondition(n>0,qs_warning_level,"some_module:nsqrt",error,failure)</code><br>
      is equivalent to <br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	call qs_assert(n>0,level=qs_warning_level,&amp;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	error_nr=qs_precondition_failed, fromWhere="some_module:nsqrt",&amp;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	message="PRECONDITION(n>0) failed in someFile.F line 675",&amp;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	error=error,failure=failure)</code>
    </p>
    <p>For a more in depth discussion of the functions see
      qs_error_handling.F.</p>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
    <p>Now some examples on how to use the error
      handling routines. First a very simple function with error handling:</p>
    <p><code>  function nsqrt(n,error)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integer :: nsqrt<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integer , intent(in) :: n<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type(qs_error), optional, intent(inout) :: error<br>
<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logical::failure<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;character(len=*), parameter :: routineN='some_module:nsqrt'<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;failure=.false.<br>
<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QSPrecondition(n>0,qs_failure_level,routineN,error,failure)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (.not.failure) then<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nsqrt=floor(sqrt(real(n)))<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QSPostcondition(nsqrt*nsqrt==n,qs_warning_level,routineN,error,failure)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nsqrt=-1<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if<br>
	end function nsqrt</code></p>
    <p>Then a routine that calls it...</p>
    <p><code>  subroutine s1(n,error)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integer , intent(in) :: n<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type(qs_error), optional, intent(inout) :: error<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print *, nsqrt(9,error=error)<br>
	end subroutine s1</code></p>
    <p>Then a routine that calls nsqrt and checks if it fails</p>
    <p><code>  subroutine s2(n,error)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integer , intent(in) :: n<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type(qs_error), optional, intent(inout) :: error<br>
<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logical::failure<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;character(len=*), parameter ::
	routineN='some_module:s2'<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integer :: mysqrt<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type(qs_error) :: iError<br>
	
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;failure=.false.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call qs_init(iError,template_error=error)
<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mysqrt=nsqrt(9,error=iError)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (failure)
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print *, "there was an
	error"<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print *,
	mysqrt<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call qs_dealloc_ref(iError,error=error)<br>
	end subroutine s2</code></p>
    <p>Finally a routine that calls s2 but suppresses the printing of warnings.</p>
    <p><code>  subroutine s3(n)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integer , intent(in) :: n<br>
	<br>	
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type(qs_error) :: error<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call qs_init(error,print_level=qs_failure_level)
<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call s2(n,error=error)<br>
	end subroutine s3</code></p>

    <h3>Parallelization</h3>
    <p>I have tried to develop the code trying to make it easy to
      parallelize it. It is not parallel, but basically all the
      operations are local to one atom. So I have tried to write the
      functions in such a way that they work one atom at time, and
      only with local data. That is for example the reason of the
      existence of qs_local_angles. This means that if the atom are
      distribueted between the processors then it should be easy to
      make my code parallel.</p>
    <p>I have used no saved or global variable, and I have tried to
      make all my functions mutithread complient (at least I think
      they are).</p>
    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    <p>Documentation is really important for code, and especially so
      for a library. I know that I have not the coerence to do much of
      it after I have finished coding something. So it is either right
      from the beginning or (almost) not at all. As cp2k uses robodoc
      I have also used it. I have some gripes with it (that it does
      not extract the function name,... from the source (as f90doc)
      and that it is quite prolix and hevyweight. On the plus side it
      makes for more professional looking code that my usual standard,
      and for a higher number of lines written ;).</p>
    <p>Anyway I have used robodoc and on the whole it works quite
      well. There is some kind of highlevel description of the code
      (like this document) that isbetter done separately, but
      otherwise all my doc is in the source (smaller probability of
      getting out of sync).</p>
    <p>Normally the documentation of the type declaration should
      contains all the attributes (also the ones that are not stored)
      and a little description of the purpose of the type. The get/set
      init/... methods often describe only differences, or special
      arguments, and make reference to the type declaration
      documentation for the rest of the arguments.</p>
    <h3>Developement aids</h3>
    <h4>Debugging</h4>
    <p>Debugging is one place where if you are not careful you can
      loose much time, and as I like to refactor my code, and
      unfortunately my changes are rarely fully bug free I have a
      couple of things that can help to find the errors more
      easily:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I have much error checking code (see the error handling
	section)</li>
      <li>I try <em>not</em> to remove the error checking/debugging
	code from my code. If it gives performace problems I use the
	global parameter <code>qs_debug</code> defined in
	qs_error_handling. It should be true in debug code and false
	in optimized code. I also have a private variable
	(<code>debug_this_module</code>) in every module to make the
	error checking more selective. So I enclose the more expensive
	checks in <code>if(qs_debug .and. debug_this_module) then
	  ... end if</code> or something similar</li>
      <li>I put breakpoints in the global stop and error handling
	routines (from my ~/.pgdbgrc):<br>
	<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	  break qs_error_handling@qs_common_error_stop<br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	  break qs_error_handling@qs_handle_error<br>
	</code>
	and then I print a stack trace of the place where the error happened.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>XEmacs</h4>
    <p>If you want to follow the guidelines then you are in for quite
      some typing, and either you are much more
      disciplined than me or you won't do it. I know I am lazy, and I
      I will anyway going to forgot something. So used extensively
      some facilities of xemacs (my editor of choice).</p>
    <h5>f90-mode</h5>
    <p>The emacs f90-mode does syntax highlighting, indenting,
      expansion of the <code>end</code> statement with the
      corresponding first token (just hit tab). Unfortunately the
      standard setting interprets <code>.F</code> files as fortran 77
      files. See my <a href="#.emacs">.emacs file</a> about how to 
      change the default.</p>
    <h5>dynamic expansions</h5>
    <p>You should use long and descriptive names, but then it is a
      pain to type them. Dynamic expansion can be a boon in these occasions</p>
    <p>M-/ (meta key and "/") search for a complection of the current
      word backwards in your file, then forward, and finally in other
      open files (hitting M-/ again cicles between the different
      complections).</p> 
    <h5>abbreviations</h5>
    <p>So you have the robodoc header,and you also need the name of
      the function in a variable, the optional variable error, and
      maybe a logical variable to keep track of failures that should
      be initialized to false... that is quite long to type... copy
      and paste is the right way to drag the inconsistencies that you
      had not fixed in the old code in the new... so maybe I don't
      need it for this small function?...<br>
      Well it is easy to get sloppy, to force myself on THE right way
      ;) I use abbreviations: type "`mstruct", and you have the module
      structure, "`sstruct" gives a subroutine structure, "`fstruct"
      the function structure, "`tstruct" the structure of the
      types,...</p>
    <p>Abbreviations need to be actived (see my 
      <a href="#.emacs">.emacs file</a>), and new
      ones can be defined with "C-x a l" (I have many more). To change
      them "M-x edit-abbrev" is useful.</p>
    <h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
    <p>I have built a TAGS table (with etags) of the files in cp2k/src and then
      with "M-." and "C-u M-." I jump to the function definitions.</p>
    <p>Search and replace can be very useful, with emacs you have
      "C-s", "C-r", "M-%", "M-C-%", the and the mighty "M-x
      tags-query-replace" and dired ("C-x-d") where
      after marking your files with "m" you can do e query regex
      substitution on the selected files by typing "Q". In qery
      replace it can be useful to stop a little to do some editing
      (with "C-r") and then continue the query replace with
      "C-M-c"</p>
    <p>I you use vi (not my case) there is a vi emulation in
      emacs. You can activate it with a menu, but to activate it by
      default you should put a <code>(viper-mode)</code> in your
      ~/.emacs</p>
    <h5><a name=".emacs">.emacs file</a></h5>
    <p>I am in no way a lisp expert, (altough I find lisp a very
      interesting language), and I know that my comments don't conform
      with the standard lisp way of commenting. Anyway here is my
      .emacs file in the home that others find it useful. If you want
      to use it copy the following in your ~/.emacs.</p>

    <h4>CVS</h4>
    <p>I use much cvs to be able to look at the old versions of my
      files. I check in (in my local repository) the files even when
      they don't compile (sometime trying to fix a bug you do many
      superfluos or wrong changes, that you will want to undo). I
      strongly encurage anyoune to do the same.</p>
