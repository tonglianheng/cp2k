    <h1>Reference counting</h1>
    <p>
      Reference counting is a memory management technique (pattern),
      that can help to share objects, using memory more efficently and
      safely.
      This technique can be applied to objects that are always
      transferred via pointers.
    </p>
    <h2>Sharing objects</h2>
    <p>
      An object (type) can be shared betweeen
      many others, by  having many objects that keep pointers to him.
      Sharing an object obviously spares memeory and keeps the data
      always in sync.
      Often this is an advantage, and it works especially well with
      immutable objects, but one must be careful with mutable objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has one drawback, namely when is it safe to deallocate the
      shared object?
      Obviously when nobody else is using it.
      Sometime the code as a special structure that make you know when
      you can deallocate the shared object, but often the things get
      messy and you either try your chance and deallocate the shared
      object or you just leave it arround, leaking memory
      (the other possibility is to just always copy the whole object,
      using up much more memory and ending up having many out-of-sync
      copies of your object).
    </p>
    <h2>Reference counting</h2>
    <p>
      Reference counting kicks in exactly at this point to help out
      deciding when it is safe to deallocate the shared object.
      The idea is really simple: just keep into the shared object a
      counter (ref_count, or reference count) of how many objects 
      are using the shared object, when ref_count hits 0 (nobody is
      using it) deallocate the shared object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping the reference count always up to date needs some
      discipline, but the guidelines to follow are quite natural.
      Central to this is the concept of ownership.
      It is thought that each objects or piece of code can "own"
      other objects.
      If you create, copy or retain (more about retain later) an
      object then you own it.
      The policy introduced by the retain-release technique is very
      simple: if you own an object you are guaranteed that it stays
      arround, but you are also responsible of releasing it when you
      no longer need it.
    </p> 
    <p>
      The basic methods of reference counting are the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>*_retain</code> increments the reference count by one, and
	must be called when you what to keep around a shared copy of the
	object (for immutable objects it can be seen as a lightweight
	copy).
	After having retained an object you own it and you are
	responsible of releasing it.
      </li>
      <li><code>*_release</code> decrements the reference count by one
	and deallocates the object if ref_count hist 0.
	It must be called when you no longer need your shared copy
	(i.e. to relinquish ownership).
	Release replaces deallocation.
      </li>
      <li><code>*_create*</code>, <code>*_copy*</code> routines give
	back an object with a retain count of one (i.e. already
	retained), so that you own it and you are responsible of
	releasing it
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	If you allocated, copied, or retained an object, then you are
	responsible for releasing the object with either -release when
	you no longer need the object. If you did not allocate, copy,
	or retain an object, then you should not release it.
      </li>
      <li>
	When you receive an object (as the result of a method call),
	it will normally remain valid until the end of your method and
	the object can be safely returned as a result of your
	method. If you need the object to live longer than this--for
	example, if you plan to store it in a type --then
	you must either -retain or -copy the object.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sample code</h2>
    <p>
      Some sample code to get a feeling of how it works...
    </p>
    <h3>code1</h3>
    <p>
      <code>
	! create the matrix structure<br>
	call cp_fmstruct_create(my_struct,...)<br>
	<br>
	! create some matrixes
	call cp_fm_create(new_matrix_1,matrix_struct=my_struct)<br>
	call cp_fm_create(new_matrix_2,matrix_struct=my_struct)<br>
	call cp_fm_create(new_matrix_3,matrix_struct=my_struct)<br>
	<br>
	! get rid of the matrix struct as we do not need it anymore<br>
	! (the matrix do, but they should look after themselves)<br>
	call cp_fm_release(my_struct)<br>
	<br>
	! work with the matrixes<br>
	...<br>
	<br>
	! get rid of the matrixes<br>
	call cp_fm_release(new_matrix_1)<br>
	call cp_fm_release(new_matrix_2)<br>
	call cp_fm_release(new_matrix_3) ! my_struct gets deallocated only here<br>
      </code>
    </p>
    <h3>code2</h3>
    <p>
      <code>subroutine my_env_set_matrix(my_env,matrix)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;type(my_env_type), pointer :: my_env<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;type(blacs_matrix_type), pointer :: matrix<br>
	<br>
	! why you should not swap the following two calls?<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;call cp_fm_retain(matrix)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;call cp_fm_relase(my_env%matrix)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;my_env%matrix => matrix<br>
	end subroutine my_env_set_matrix<br>
<br>
	...<br>
<br>
	! in the deallocation subroutine of my env<br>
	! either release if (my_env%ref_count==0) or a plain<br>
	! deallocate routine<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;call cp_fm_release(my_env%matrix)
    </code>
    </p>
    <h2>Mixing &amp; details</h2>
    <p>
      cp2k does not use retain and release consequently (and it isn't
      always good to pass types by pointer, as nedeed by reference
      counting), so it is nice to have some conventions about how to
      treat objects that don't implement reference counting.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the object is just passed in it is copied
      </li>
      <li>if the argument name ends with _ptr, the object is passed as
	pointer, and deallocated when no longer nedeed (if not
	explictly noted otherwise)
      </li>
      <li>if there is a logical variable named <code>owns_*</code> or 
	<code>shoul_dealloc_*</code> then the object is shared and
	deallocation depends on the value of that variable.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>My retain and release have the following propreties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>it is ok to release an unassociated pointer</li>
      <li>When a pointer is released it is <em>always</em> nullified</li>
      <li>it is an error to retain an unassociated pointer</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>References</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Geamma et al., Patterns (Reference counting, I think)</li>
      <li>Cocoa uses reference counting and there have been a couple
	of articles on it. They discuss retain cycles, but also
	autorelease pools, an extension to reference counting to be
	able to return temporary objects.
	This is not implemented in cp2k and hopefully avoidable
	(seeing the kind of code that there is in cp2k)<br>
