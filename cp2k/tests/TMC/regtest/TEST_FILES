# runs are executed in the same order as in this file
# the second field tells which test should be run in order to compare with the last available output
# e.g. 0 means do not compare anything, running is enough
#      1 compares the last total energy in the file
#      6 looks for the final energy of the MC simulation
#      for details see cp2k/tools/do_regtest

# The whole TMC method could only run in paralell (serial should finalize well, but do nothing)
#
# testing global tree creation using single exact potential, the deterministic random number generator
#   with the standard move types, check if at the end the same configuration is created (energy)
