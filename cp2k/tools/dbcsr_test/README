Testing:

* The dbcsr_testing.py script runs several tests of the addition and
  multiplication operations.  Tests are described in .par files in this
  directory or its subdirectories.

* Building: compile CP2K as usual but use the dbcsr_test target, i.e.,
cd $CP2K_HOME/src
make -j -f ../makefiles/Makefile ARCH=Linux-x86-64-gfortran VERSION=psmp dbcsr_test

* Running, example:
  python dbcsr_testing.py -n "n1 n2 ns" -t "t1 t2 ts" -e "../../exe/Linux-x86-64-gfortran/dbcsr_test_driver.psmp"
  to test all combinations of node counts from n1 to n2 with stride ns
  and thread counts from t1 to t2 with stride ts.


Performance:

* Building: compile CP2K as usual but use the dbcsr_test target, i.e.,
cd $CP2K_HOME/src
make -j -f ../makefiles/Makefile ARCH=Linux-x86-64-gfortran VERSION=psmp dbcsr_test

* Running:

  Modify the perf/test.perf input file and pass it as standard input
  to the executable generated above, e.g.,
mpiexec -np 4096 ../../exe/Linux-x86-64-gfortran/dbcsr_performance_driver < perf/test.perf
