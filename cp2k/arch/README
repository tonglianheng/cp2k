The arch files provided here should be used as examples, your local setup (in particular paths to libraries will invariably differ). Furthermore, some of the arches might be as much outdated as the corresponding hardware/OS. There are particular caveats for the following machines/compilers.

g95:
typically doing fine. If the current snapshot fails, try the stable version (which cannot be used for our LIBINT interface, though).

PGI compilers:
tend to miscompile CP2K. Be sure to run a full regtest without segfaults before believing your compiler works.

Intel compilers:
Recent compilers (9.1) seem to be doing well. Be sure the allow for enough stack size as otherwise you might see segfaults (see Intel's release notes). In a bash shell, use 'ulimit -s 256000'

IBM XL compilers:
The XLF 10 compiler on AIX has been observed to fail when compiling md_run.F due to the large number of modules USE'd in this file.  If you see the following error message then either use a newer version of the compiler (11 and 12 work fine) or revert to a version of the code prior to 16th Oct 2008:
  1517-011: (U) Compilation ended. No more system resources available.
  1501-511  Compilation failed for file md_run.f90.
