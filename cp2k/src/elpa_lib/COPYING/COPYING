Licensing and copyright terms for the ELPA library:
ELPA Consortium (2011)

****

Copyright of the original code rests with the authors inside the ELPA
consortium. The copyright of any additional modifications shall rest
with their original authors, but shall adhere to the licensing terms
set forth below.

****

The code is distributed under ALMOST all of the the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public License version 3 (LGPL). The full text
can be found in the file "lgpl.txt" in this repository. "lgpl.txt"
makes reference to the GPL v3, which can also be found in this
repository ("gpl.txt").

While we are not allowed to alter the license texts as written in those 
files, IN ADDITION our own license prescribes two important
modifications / clarifications to the original lgpl.txt:

- In point 2., clause b) - stating that that you may redistribute
  under the terms of the plain GNU GPL - shall NOT apply. In other
  words, if you redistribute, you MUST keep the additional permissions
  of the LGPL v3 in place.

- If you redistribute, you must redistribute under the terms of the
  LGPL version specified here. Using later or earlier versions
  published by anyone except the ELPA copyright holders is
  not allowed. 

****

When in doubt, talk to us. What we would like to ensure is that the ELPA
code can be used as needed, while providing a strong incentive for
others to contribute their modifications back to the original development.
