pseudo_2.3 is an extended version of pseudo_2.2. It allows the
simultaneous fit of goedecker-type pseudopotentials against several
selected atomic reference states. This should improve the
transferability of the pseudopotentials.  Before using pseudo_2.3 one
has to read the README for pseudo_2.2.  pseudo_2.3 works essentially
the same as pseudo_2.2. There are only small differences if more than
one atomic reference configuration is considered. As long as only one
atomic reference configuration is used pseudo_2.3 takes the same input
as pseudo_2.2 (in fact in this case one should prefer the program
pseudo_2.2!)


Differences if more the one atomic reference state is used:
----------------------------------------------------------

The file 'atom.ae' now contains data of more than one atomic state.
The atomic all electron calculation is still done with the program
atm.f (see corresponding README).

The file 'weights.par' now contains two additional lines (third and
forth line). Example for 'weights.par':

This is an example for a calculation where 10 different configurations
are considered. The penalty-function is given by:

penalty = sum_(i=1)^(nconf){ wghtcf[i]*sqrt(penal_cf[i]) + dE_excit[i}
                            * whgtex[i] }

where penal_cf[i] is the penalty-function for the configuration i as
used in pseudo_2.2 (see README for pseudo_2.2) and dE_excit[i} is the
error in the excitation energy for configuration i. nconf is the
number of configurations (i.e. 10). The first state is taken as the
ground state (excitation energy = zero!). wghtcf[i] and whgtex[i] are
the weights for the different configurations and excitation energies,
respectively.
