The directory PADE contains the LDA Goedecker pseudopotentials. 

The directory ATOM contains the source for the atomic program.  Due to
copyright reasons this atomic code is not completely identical to the
one that has been used for the reference calculations of the LDA
pseudopotentials. Therefore for the heavier elements small differences
in the pseudopotential/all electron eigenvalues and charges exist.

The directory PSEUDO contains the sources for two programs to fit the
parameters of Goedecker pseudopotentials. A directory with some
examples is also included.

The directory PAPER contains two publications about the Goedecker
pseudopotentials.
